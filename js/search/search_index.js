components and services to help you build dual-screen experiences for foldable or dual-screen devices, such as the Surface Duo\n\nTODO: screenshot demo\nSee the [Live Demo](TODO URL)\nStatus\nThis is currently an experimental project aiming to explore how existing web apps could be adapted to build responsive UIs on dual-screen devices, with as little changes as possible on the code.\nHow to test on your browser\nThe dual-screen emulation feature requires Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome canary versions for now, with experimental flags to enable.\nFollow the instructions here to setup your browser for dual-screen emulation.\nLibrary usage\nCheck out the demo source code to see an example usage of the library.\nAdd the library to your Angular project:\nnpm install ngx-foldableImport the library in your app:\nimport { FoldableModule } from 'ngx-foldable';\n...\n\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [\n    FoldableModule\n    ...\n  ],\n  ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Use the provided fdSplitLayout, fdWindow and fdIfSpan directives to build your layout:\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    This will be displayed on the first window segment of a multi screen or single screen device.\n\n    This is only visible on a single screen device.\n    This is only visible on a multi screen device.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    This will be displayed on the second window segment of a multi screen device.\n\n    This is only visible on multi screen device, regardless of the orientation.\n    This is only visible on horizontal fold spanning.\n    This is only visible on vertical fold spanning.\n  \nUsing the ScreenContext service, you can also receive updates when the screen context changes:\nimport { ScreenContext } from 'ngx-foldable';\n...\nexport class AppComponent {\n  constructor(private screenContext: ScreenContext) {\n    this.screenContext\n      .asObservable()\n      .subscribe(context: ScreenContextData) {\n        console.log('Screen context changed:', context);\n      }\n  }\n}You can read the full documentation [here](TODO link).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n
